Network-

  .A network is collection of devices that are connected through media. The characteristics of a network are as follows:
    
    .Devices contain services and resources.
    .Network connects users to the available services.
    .Connecting devices allow users to share resources more efficiently.
    
Internetworking Models

  .With the inception of networks, hardware and software from different manufacturers could not interoperate. 
  To build hardware and software that can interoperate, a model with communication functions is required.
  
    .Importance of Internetworking Models
      .They encourage interoperability
      .Models provide a reference to describe the process of data communication
      .Models Facilitate modular engineering (high layer - low layer)
      
Types of Networking Models

  .Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) reference model
  .Transmission Control Protocol/ Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) model
  
OSI Reference Model was developed by the International Standards Organization (ISO). The 7 layers of (OSI) 
Reference Model are as follows:

  .User
    .Layer 7

Network Topology
  .Network topology deals with how devices are connected (search for a chart as refrence)
  .The different network topologies are as shown below.
    .Point-to-Point Topology
    .Bus Topology
    .Ring Topology
    .Star Topology
    .Full Mesh Topology
    .Partial Mesh Topology

Point-to-Point Topology
  .In a point-to-point topology, only 2 devices are connected to each other through the medium. This 
  is typical in Wide Area Network (WAN) connections.
  
          DEVICE A .---------------------------------. DEVICE B

Bus Topology
  In bus topology, all device are attached to a single cable. This was used for Token Ring networks.
  
  
  CABLE------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
              ^                             ^                                   ^
          Device A                      Device B                            Device C

Ring Topology
  .In a ring toplogy, each device is attached to only one other device either side. This is often used
  with severs.
  
                        Device A                      Device D
                                        O
                        Device B                      Device C

Star Topology
  .In a star topology, multiple devices are connected to a central device. This is the most widespread topology
  in networks today.
  
  PC-A---------------------------|                      |----------------------------PC-B

  PC-C---------------------------|                      |----------------------------PC-D
  
  Full Mesh Topology
    .In full mesh toplogy, all the device are interconnected. There are many backup paths from one
    device to another.
    
    Device A -                                                  - Device D
    
                                  X
    
    Device B -                                                  - Device C
  
Partial Mesh
  .In a partial mesh topology, some of the full mesh connections are dropped. This makes is less
  expensive and easier to implement.

  Core                                        .It has high bandwidth links.
                                              .It connects the distribution layer device to each other and 
                                              the centralized resource.
                                              .It consists of high-end switches
  
  Distribution                                .It provides routing, packet filtering using Access Control List
                                              (ACL's), and Quality of Service (QoS).
                                              .WAN access also occurs at this layer.
                                              .Routers and Layer 3 switches are used here.
                                              
  Access                                      .End devices connect to the network, usually with a switch.
  
  Layer 1 and 2 ethernet
    .Ethernet is the most widely used technology for Local Area Networks (LANs) today.
    It is a FAMILY of standards maintained by the Institute of Electrical Engineers (IEEE) defined into
    two OSI model layers:
                                    Layer 1 (physical)
    OSI Model Layers-----------------|
                                    Layer 2 (data Link)
                                    
  IEEE Ethernet standards are given below:
  
                                                                 IEEE Ethernet Standards

Ethernet at the Physical Layer
  .There are many physical layers in the Ethernet standards. However, they use the same data link layer standards.
    .The maximum length of a copper cable is 100 meters (about 328 feet) for most standards.
    .The standards listed for copper use Unshielded Twisted Pair (UTP) copper cable, expect Thicknet.
      !!!! Characteristics of Ethernet !!!!
        .The UTP cable used contains 4 pairs of wires
        .Only 2 of the pairs are used for Ethernet and FastEthernet
        .All 4 pairs are used for GigabitEthernet

Ethernet Data Link Layer
  !!!! The IEEE splits the Ethernet data link layer into two sublayers !!!!

                                    Sublayers
                            |                           |
            802.3 Media Access Control (MAC)      802.2 Logical Link Control (LLC)
                            |                           |
    Responsible for data encapsulation and          Handles communication within Layers 1 and 3
    addressing.
    
Media Access Control Address
  .The Media Access Control (MAC) address is the physical address of the Network INterface Card (NIC).
  it consists of 48 bits (6 bytes) respresented in hexadecimal digits.
    .The first 3 bytes are the Organizantionally Unique Identifier (OUI) that indicates the vendor.
    .The last 3 bytes are assigned by the vendor.
  !!!! this address can be assigned or it can be a Burned-In-Address (BIA) !!!!
  
Ethernet Frame
  .The fields and functions of Ethernet Frame are shown below.
  
  Fields                                            Functions
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Preamble                                          Provides sychronization.
  Start Frame Delimiter                             Signals the beginning of address
  MAC Destination Address                           This is the destination of the frame
  MAC Source Address                                This is the source of the frame
  Protocol Type                                     This usually the code for IPv4 (0x0800) or IPv6 (0x86DD).
  Data                                              It contains Layer 1 bytes. Padding is added to meet the minimum 46-byte
                                                    requirement, if necessary.
  Frame Check Sequence (FCS)                        This is used to check for transmission errors.
  
Duplex
  .Devices communicate with each other using full or half duplex.
  
  ! Half duplex !
    .Only one device can transmit over the medium at a time.
    .Data collisions are possible with half duplex.
    
  ! Full duplex !
    .Both devices can trasmit and recieve at the same time.
    .Switches and router can use full duplex.

Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection
  .To detect collisions in half duplex communication, Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision
  Detection (CSMA/CD) is used. This is a contention method.
    .When a device has a frame to transmit, it monitors until there is no activity on the medium.
    .It sends the frame, but also listens at the same time.
    .If the devcie detects other signals on the medium, there is a collision.
    .In case of a collision, all devices transmitting at that time send a jamming signal. Each then
    chooses a random amount of time before retransmitting. This called the backoff time.
    
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  .A TCP header contains the following fields, among others:
    .Source and destination port numbers,
    .Sequence number,
    .Acknowledgement number,
    .Window size, and
    .Checksum.
  
  Each segment is assigned a sequence number. The sequence numbers are used:
    .To determine any segment that require retransmission.
    .To reassemble the segment in order, at the destination.

  .Is a 3-way "handshake" which is the beginning of a TCP connection.
    1. SYN - the source sends the sequence number
    2. SYN/ACK - acknowledeges the number andis ready for another one
    3. ACK - the source tells the destination to keep transmitting.
    
Windowing
  .Is a process used by TCP to contrl how much data is sent at once.
    !!!! If there is large amounts of traffic the window is made smaller !!!!
    !!!! If the bandwidth is available the window is increased !!!!

User Datagram Protocol

                                                        UDP Header Fields
                                    Source Port (16 bits)           |           Destination Ports (16 bits)
                                    Length (16 bits)                |           Checksum (16 bits)
                                                                   DATA

  UDP is used when:
    .reliable transport is not necessary, for example, when looking up a DNS name.
    .the delay introduced by TCP is unacceptable, for example, in Voice over IP (VoIP).
  
Port Numbers
  .Assigning of port numbers are as followed
    0 - 1023          | Well-known ports
    1024 - 49151      | Registered ports
    49152 - 65535     | Private or dynamic ports
      
      !!!! TCP and UDP both use port numbers as address !!!!
      !!!! Dynamic ports are used to allocate ephemeral ports !!!!
      !!!! Well-Known or registered ports are used for destination ports !!!!
      
Layers 3 Protocols
  .Layer 3 adds an Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) or Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) source
  and destination address to the segement recieved from Layer 4.
    . IP source and Destination address are the logical address for a device or router interface.
    . This compares to the physical addresses that are used at Layer 2.
    
  Other important protocols at Layer 3 for IPv4 are:
    .Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)
    .Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)
    
Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)

      !!!! ARP request message sent out !!!!
      .Looking for the physical (MAC) address of anode with IP address is:
      192.168.1.120
      
Router/Host (ARP request)
  IP: 192.168.1.110
  IP: 192.168.1.120
  IP: 192.168.1.130
  
                                                IP: 192.168.1.110
  Router/Host        (ARP reply) -----------    IP: 192.168.1.120
                      Physical Address is       IP: 192.168.1.130

  !!!! (IPv4) TTL and bits concerning fragmentation feild and function of IPv4 !!!!
    .If the number of bytes in the data, causes the packet to be too big to send to the network, it is fragmented. 
    (meaning it is sent in more than one IP packet)
    .When a packet arrives at a router, the router decriments the TTL field by 1, When the TTL feild is 0 the router discards the packet
    .TTL prevents the packets from looking for a none exsisting address indefinitly.
    .Without TTL there would be many packets taken up bandwidth.
    
Layer 2 Protocol
  .Addressing used at layer 2 is flat.
  .There is no hierarchy involved.

IPv4 Addressing and Subnetting
  Objectives !
    .Discuss IP address
    .Convert binary numbers to decimals
    .Discuss classes
    .Create subnets
-------------------------------------
IPv4 Address
  .An IPv4 address is a 32-bit numeric identifier assigned to each device on an IP network.
    > Unicast- The packet is sent to only one device.
    > Multicast- The packet to many devices 
    > Broadcast- The packet is sent to all devices in a network or subnet.
    > Public- These addresses can be used over the internet.
    > Private- These addresses are used only within a LAN.

Private Addresses
  . Are also called Request for Comments (RFCs) 1918 addresses.
  . Can only be used within a private network.
  . Cannot be routed through the internet.
  . Enable organizations to work with fewer routable address.
  
Binary Numbering 
  .Counting in binary system is similar to counting in any other number system.
    >Binary system
      .sends signals that are interpreted as either 0 (zero) or 1 (one)
      .Works in the same way as the decimal system except that it uses only 0 and 1
    
    >Decimal system
      .Uses 10 symbols
      .Signifies a power of 10 when each digit is added to a decimal number
  
Bits and Bytes
  !!! terms are related to digital information in computing !!!
    .A bit is one digit, either a 1 or a 0
    .A byte is 8 bits.
    .An octet is a byte used in the IPv4 address dotted decimal format.
Bits and Bytes (contd.)

  |     Binary Number                 |       Power of 2      |   Decimal Equivalent      | 
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  |       00000001                    |       -               |         1                 |
  |       00000010                    |     2^1               |         2                 |
  |       00000100                    |     2^2               |         4                 |

  Binary to Dotted Decimal
  A dotted decimal address in binary is 4 bytes seperated by periods. 
    !!!! Example !!!!
      11000000.00010000.00001101.00000001 = the decimal equivalent is: 192.16.13.1

Converting Binary To Decimal
  .To convert 10110001 to a decimal number, find the place values of 1 bit in the binary number:
    .There is a 1 in the 2^7 place = 128.
    .There is a 1 in the 2^5 place. the decimal equation becomes 128 + 32 = 160
    .There is a 1 in the 2^4 place. The decimal equation becomes 160 + 16 = 176
    .Finally, there is a 1 in the ones column
    .Add 1 to 176
    .Result is 177. the decimal equivalent of the binary number 101110001 is 177
    
Special Addresses
  !!! Three types of special address are as follow !!!
    >Host 
      .Refers to an address that can be assigned to a network device
    > Network 
      .Refers to an address that represents an entire network.
    > Broadcast
      .Refers to the last address belonging to the network

Valid Host Addresses
  .Valid host address are address between the network and the broadcast address. The number of valid host address is 2^n-2, (n)
  is the number of host bits borrowed for the subnet.
    Class A network - The valid host addresses are 10.0.0.1 through 10.255.255.254
    Class B network - The valid addresses are 172.16.0.1 through 172.16.255.254
    Class C network - The valid host address 192.168.100.1 through 192.168.100.254

Subnet Masks 
  .A subnet mask
    .defines the number of bits that represent the network and subnet part of the address.
    .identifies the destination IP address and determines network path Layer 3 devices

Subnets 
  Class A, B, or C networks can be subdivided into smaller networks called subnets.
  The advantage of subnetting are as follows:
    .Smaller networks are easier to manage
    .Overall traffic is reduced
    .Network security policies are more easily applied

Creating Subnets
  .Subnets can be created by borrwoing bits from the bits to creat a subnet field.
    !!! Using 1-bit for the subnet field 2^1 or 2 possible subnets !!! refer to bits and bytes for further break down
  ** With 6-bits for the subnet field only two bits are left for the host, that yeilds 2^2 or 4 host.
  ** Two address are set aside for network and broadcast address. At this point, no subnetting is possible. 
  .A Variable Length Subnet Mask (VLSM) address uses such subnets.
  .the IP SUBNET-ZERO command needs to be considered when counting the number of subnets.

VLSM Summarization and Troubleshooting TCP IP

Objectives!

  . Describe the benefits of VLSM's
  . Calculate VLSM IP addressing design to a network
  . Describe subnetting a network
  . Define summarization and switching
  . Describe the switching process and routing
  . Explain troubleshooting steps for TCP/IP
-----------------------------------------------------
Variable Length Subnet Masks (VLSMs)

VLSMs allow a network administrator to create many networks from a large single network using subnets masks of different lengths.
  . The Subnet address is created by taking address bits from the host portion of Class A, Class B, and Class C addresses.
  . When taking (borrowing) a bit from the host feild the number of additional subnets created double each time.
---------------------------------------------------------  
Advantage of VLSMs Addressing Design

VLSMs provide two major advantages:
  . More effecient use of addressing
  . Ability to perform route summarization
  
When borrowing a bit from the host field, the number of additional subnets created is doubled each time.

For example:
. Borrowing 1 bit creates two possible subnets (2^1=2).
. Borrowing 2 bits creates four possible subnets (2^2=4).
** the number of bits borrowed determines the block size.

Block Size

Block size is the number of address in the subnet.

. A block size must be a power of 2 and large enough to accommodate 2 address that must be reserved- the network and the broadcast addresses.
. Therefore the usable portion of the block size is a power of 2 minus 2.

For example:
  . If you need 27 hosts, a block size of 32 is required. 2^5-2=30 hosts are available.
  . If you need 13 hosts, a block size of 16 is required. 2^4-2=14 hosts are available.
  . If you need 62 hosts, a block size of 32 is required. 2^8-2=126 hosts are available.

. A point to point serial link to another router needs only 2 hosts and a block size of 4.

Subnetting

Subnetting is done by borrowing host bits and using them as network bits.

Subnetting is useful to:
  . simplify network administration.
  . enable different uses of physical media subnet as Ethernet and FDDI.
  . add layers of security to network.
  
  Example of Subnetting
  
  . (A) network uses Class (B) network address where 16 bits are used for the network and 16 bits for the hosts.
  . the network administator has to create 4 subnets
  . there are 65,536 (2^16) possible addresses, of these, 65,534 are usable addresses.
  . If two bits are borrowed, 14 host bits are left.
  . Possible combinations of 0s and 1s occur in the remaining 14 bits.
  . this gives 16,384 possible hosts for each subnet.
  
  VLSM Class C Addresses 
  
  The following table gives an overview of how to use VLSM Class C addresses:
  
  Subnet Mask         |      Prefix Length     |    Subnets/Network     |   Hosts/Subnet   |    Toatal Hosts/Network   |
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  255.255.255.128                /25                     2                     126                    254        
  255.255.255.192                /26                     4                      62                    248
  255.255.255.224                /27                     8                      30                    240
  255.255.255.240                /28                    16                      14                    224
  255.255.255.248                /29                    32                       6                    192
  255.255.255.252                /30                    64                       2                    124
  
  Maximizing Hosts or Subnets
  . A network administrator has to make a choice between maximizing the number of hosts and the number of subnets depending on the future expansion in the network.
    If there would be an expansion in the department and branches_____then____> maximize the number of SUBNETS
    If organizational structure is stable, and more people will be hired_____then____> maximize the number of HOSTS
  
  Subnetting Based on Required number of Hosts
  ** lets consider the requirments of 2000 hosts.
  . An allocation of Class B network would yield 65,534 hosts, more than what is required.
  . Subnetting the /16 network into eight /24 subnets would yield 254 hosts (252 usable hosts).
  . The total number of hosts supported after subnetting is 2,032.
  . The eight /24 subnets would be 130.100.0.0, 130.100.0.1, etc. till 130.100.0.7, all with /24 prefix lengths.
    -Consider a network that uses private Class C network 192.16.1.0/24. The number of host address required is 57.
    This requires a block size of 64 (2^6). Two bit would be left for subnetting. This yields 4 (2^2) subnets.
    
    Subnet Address   |      Host Range            |   Broadcast Address   |
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------
    192.168.1.0        192.168.1.1-192.168.1.62     192.168.1.63                                            
    192.168.1.64       192.168.1.65-192.168.1.126   192.168.1.127
    192.168.1.128      192.168.1.129-192.168.1.190  192.168.1.191
    192.168.1.192      192.168.1.193-192.168.3.254  192.168.1.255
    
   VLSM for Network Addressing
    Porcess of planning network addressing using VLSM can be split into 5 steps
    1. Determine required host bits
    2. Pick a subnet for the largest network to use
    3. Pick the 2nd largest
    4. Pick 3rd largest
    5. Determine subnets for serial links
    
    Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) is also called supernetting or adress aggregation.
      -It is the opposite of subnetting.
      -a CIDR address has a prefix length less that than the classfull prefix length, i.e,92.168.1.16/16
      -Internet Service Providers (ISPs) often use CIDR to allocate addresses to their clients.
      
     Summarization
     Also called route aggregation, allows routing protocols to advertise many networks as one address.
     -This reduces the size of routing tables, which in turn saves memory and cpu utilization.
     -Steps in summarization for 192.168.16.0/24 throgh 192.168.31.0/24 are:
      -Find the correct block size
      -Find the network address for th summary network.
        -always the first address in the block
      -Find the summary mask. yields a mask of a block size /16 255.255.240.0.0
      
     Switching
     Switching consists of forwarding frames at Layer 2.
      -A Switch can forward frames within a network. It must rely on the router to handle traffic for other networks.
      -A switchvforward frames based on the Media Access Control (MAC) destination address.
      -The MAC address table constructed contains a MAC address and the corresponding port.
      this is the port used to send frames to the destination address from the switch.
      
     Switching Process 
     -The three switches boot
     -As each frame os received by S1, it adds the MAC address and corresponding incoming port to the MAC address table.
     S1 MAC 00.00.00.00.a2 port F0/5 .learns two destinations
     S3 MAC 00.00.00.00.a3 port F0/4
     S2 MAC 00.00.00.00.a1 port F0/6
     
     Routing
     Router are used to route packets destined for nonlocal networks.
     -i.e,the router Fa0/0 interface is in the same subnet as PC's A and B, the 192.168.1.0/24 network. The other router interface, 
     Fa0/1, is in the same subnet as PCs C and D, the 192.168.2.0/24 network.

  Routers are used to route packets from (pc)a&b to (pc)c&d 
    -destined for no local networks
  
  Router interface Fa0/0
  -same subnet as (PC)s a&b 
   Router interface Fa0/1
  -same subnet as (PC)s c&d
  
  S2 can take care of forwarding frames within the 192.168.1.0/24 network.
  It can forward frames between S2 and PC a and b.
    - If S2 receieves a frame, whose destination IP address and mask show that it is not in the 
    192.168.1.0/24 network, then the switch passes the frame to it default gateway
    - Defualt gateways for an end device, such as a PC are either manually configured
  or dynamically assigned through Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)
    - Layer 2 switches can also have defualt gateways
    
  Gateway
  is a routing interface that takes packets  beyond the local network.
  
  for 192.168.1.0 would be 192.168.1.254 Fa0/0
  
  Troubleshooting
  The procedure for routing shows areas to troubleshoot. Use PING command at the DOS prompt to reach
  - The default gateway
  - The IP destination address
  - the hostname of the destination
  If the PING command is successful for the IP address but not for the hostname, the problem probably involves DNS.
  To trouble shoot a network, you must be familiar with its IP address scheme.

  Lesson 6:
  Cisco Internetwork Orerating System
  
  Objectives:
  . Describe the basis Cisco Internetwork Operating System
  commands
  . Explain the operation status of an Ethernet interface
  . Describe the basic network device security system.
  --------------
  Cisco Internetwrok Operating System
  Cisco Internetwork Operating System (IOS) is the proprietary Kernel of Cisco routers and Catalyst switches
  . When a Cisco router or switch boots, the (IOS) user interface is in user exec mode.
  . The prompt for the user exec mode is hostname>
  . The hostname defaults to Switch or Router. It can be configured with the hostname, hostname command.
  . Very few Commands are available in user exec mode, layers for security.
  
  Privileged Exec Mode
  The heart of the IOS is privileged exec mode. the privileged exec mode allows the device configuration to be viewed or changed.
  . To enter privileged exec mode, use the enable command. the prompt for this mode is: hostname#
  . To return to user mode use the disable command. The prompt will change back to the user exec prompt:
  . An enable password is a password that can be configured to protect access to privileged exec mode.
    -For no encryption: enable password password
    -For encrypytion: enable secret password
      .The enable secret overrides the enable password.
 
 Configuration Mode 
 In privleged exec mode, the following command enters configuration mode, also called global configuration mode:
  . Router#configure terminal
  . Router(config)#
  
  Within a configuration mode are many subnets, i.e, for interfaces:
  . Router(config)interface Fa0/0
  . Router(config-if)#
  
  To exit configuration submode, enter the exit command. To exit configuration mode, enter end.
  
  Help
  At any time, enter a question mark at the prompt.All available commands in that mode will be displayed. For example. In configuration mode:
  Router#configure terminal
  command:Router(config)#int Fa0/1
  command:router(config)#?
  . Router#show_?
  
  History
  Show History command displays a history of commands that have been entered. in configuration mode, history parameters can be changed:
  . terminal history- Enables history, default size is 10lines
  . terminal history size 50
  . terminal no history size - Reset to 10 lines
  . terminal no history - Disables history
  
  These settings can also be set specifically for the Virtual Teletype (VTY) lines:
  . line vty 0 4
  . history size 1
  
  The Configuration
  The Configuration that is active and stored in RAM is called the running configuration. The configuration that has been saved in NVRAM and will be loaed at the next boot
  is called the startup configuration.
  . To show the configuration that is active-----show running-config
  . To show the configuration that has been saved and will be loaded at the next boot------show startup-config
  . To make the startup configuration match the running configuration, use ------copy running-config stratup-config
  . The show commands above show the passwords entered in plain text. To encrypt the passwords(for display purposes only), configure
  -------service password-encryption
  The service password-encryption comman can be entered before or after entering the passwords.
  Remove the encryption with the command - no service password-encryption
  This command will NOT convert already encrypted passwords to plaintext.
  .Type 7 Cisco-propritetary weak encryption
  .Type 5 uses MD5 and is more secure but must be invoked manully for each password
  configured, for example enable secret instead of enable password.
  
  SHOW Commands
  In privileged exec mode, there are many commands that begin with the word show. 
  These display information on the hardware, licensing, software, and configuration of the device.
  
  Commands                |Function
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  show interfaces         | Displays all the statistics for all the interfaces on the router
  show interfaces s0/1    | Displays statistics for the interface serial 0/1
  show ip interfaces brief| Displays summary information for the interfaces
  show clock              | Shows the time set in the router
  show hosts              | Displays a cached list of host names and addresses
  show users              | Displays all users who are connected to the router
  show flash              | Displays info about flash memory and IOS files stored
  show version            | Displays the IOS image and version that is running in RAM
  show arp                | Dispalys the ARP table of the router
  show start              | Displays the saved configuration located in non-volatile random access
                            memory (NVRAM)
  show run                | Displays the configuration currently running in random access memory (RAM)
  show protocol           | Displays the status of any layer 3 protocols
  
  
  Name Lookup & Domain Name System
  The configurations of Domain Name System (DNS)are shown below.
  
  Using DNS                 |         Using DNS
  hostname Yosemite           Production networks invariably use Domain Name System.
  ip domain-name example.com  Here the domain name and 2 DNS servers are configured.
  ip name-server-
  10.1.1.10010.1.2.100
  
  W/O DNS; local lookup only |     W/O DNS; local lookup only
  hostname Yosemite            To refer to others, this router sets up
                               a link between a name and address.
  ip host R3-FA00 10.1.0.2     In this example the yosemite host can now use the ping R3-FA00
  ip host R3-SERIAL01 10.2.0.1 command or the ping 10.1.0.2 command.
  
  No DNS or local lookup     |   No DNS or local lookup
  no ip domain-lookup          In this case, specifying no lookup will 
                               prevent the device from searching for a name 
                               refrence when an incorrect command is entered.
  
  Passwords 
  Passwords can be configured to protect access to the device. Different passwords can be used for each of the purposes.
  
  Purpose                    | Configurations
  Password protect access to  For Type 7 use the enable password command
  privileged exec mode:       For Type 5 use the enable secret comman        
  
  Password protect access to  Router(config)#line console 0 
  the console line:           Router(config-line)#password password
                              Router(config-line)#login
  
  Password Protect access     Router(config)#line vty 0 4
  using Telnet or SSH         Router(config-line)#password password
  to the device:              Router(config-line)#login
  
 
 EXEC-TIMEOUT Command 
 The exec-timeout command specifies how many minutes and seconds of idle time will pass before the session is terminated.
 It defaults to 15 minutes.
 
 On the console line 
 Router(config)#line 0
 Router(config-line)#exec-timeout minutes seconds
 Router(config-line)#login
 
 On the VTY line, for Telnet or SSH sessions to the device
 Router(config)#line VTY 0 4
 Router(config-line)#exec-timout
 minutes seconds
 Router(config-line)#login
 
 Banners
 A banner is the message that is displayed on the screen when a user is at various stages of the login process.
 Different banners can be configured.
 
 .When connecting to the device this banner is displayed:
  -S1(config)# banner motd "xxx"
 
 .The following banner is displayed at login
  -S1(config)# banner login "xxx"
 
 .After the user successfully logs in, the following banner is displayed
  -S1(coS1(config)# banner exec "xxx"
  
Debugging 
The show commands are used to verify and troubleshoot configurations.
The debug commands let you witness events as the occur.

Options to stop debugging
.Re-enter the debug command, proceded with the word no
.Enter undebug all command. The short form of this command is u all
.Reboot the device ( May not be possible in a production system)

Configuring an Ethernet Interface
To configure an Ethernet Interface, perform the following steps.

.Enter the configuration mode
.Specify the interface
.Assign an IP address and subnet mask
.Enter the no shutdown comman to enable the interface
i.e

Router#conf t
Enter configuration commands, one per line. End with CNTL/Z.
Router(config)#interface Ethernet1/0
Router(config-if)#ip address 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0
Router(config-if)#no shutdown

After entering no shutdown command, two messages will appear:
 .%LINK-3-UPDOWN: Interface Ethernet1/0 changed state to up ( indicates the link is physically up)
 .%LINEPROTO-5-UPDOWN: Line protocol interface Ethernet1/0, changed state to up (indicates the line protocol is up)
*Both the link state and line protocol must be up for the traffic to pass.

This command is used in the interface configuration mode:
 .Router(config-if)#shutdown

Two messages appear:
.%LINK-5-changed: interface Ethernet1/0, changed state to administratively down
.%LINEPROTO-5-UPDOWN: Line protocol on Interface Ethernet1/0, changed state to down
*When the shutdown command is entered on an interface, the link is not just down; it is adminstratively down.


SHOW IP INTERFACES BRIEF Command
Status of all the interfaces on the router are shown below:

Router#show ip interfaces brief

Interface       |     IP-Address    |  OK?Method Status  |    Protocol    |
Ethernet0/0       10.0.2.10            YES manual up            up
Ethernet1/0       10.0.1.10             YES manual up           up

Lesson 7

Managing a Cisco Internetwork

Objectives
.Describe network architechtures for small office/home office and small to medium sized businesses
.Explain the considerations for wirless access to a network
.Follow a frame or a packet through an internetwork for troubleshooting purposes.


Newtwork Architecture
Network Architecure refurs to the way devices are connected to form a network. For small
office/home office (SOHO) environments, the architecture is simpler than in enterprise enviornments.

.Network arch. in a SOHO environment:

                        .One subnet is used for all devices
SOHO environments |     .Static routes are used for routing
                        .Full-time netowrk administrator is not required
                        
SOHO Architecture
The characteristics of a SOHO architecture are:
.The router,switch,and firewall functions are combined into one all-purpose device.
.The device acts as a DHCP sever for the PC's
.The Internet Service Provides (ISP) provides one internet address.
.The device has a defualt route to the Internet
.Network Address Translation (NAT) is implemented to reach the internet.

Small to Medium-Sized Business Architecture
In small to medium sized business architecture, one all purpose device does not exist.
.The switch and router functions are seperated.
.The router uses firewall software

4pc-----switch-----router---internet
                        VPN Tunnel
                        
Characteristics
.Depending o the business, there may be a site to site VPN that encrypts traffic between
this business and its suppliers and/or customers.
.There are varied types of traffic on the network.
.Network management and /or monitor software is installed to monitor the status of the devices and traffic.
.Wirless access can be provided


Wirless Access
The device must be connected for a network to function. the connections can be wired or wireless.
With wireless access:
.data transmits over air
.you can connect to the internet in a business of any size
.an access point is required.
.transmissions are easily intercepted.


Documention
Documention is important for understanding the flow of data in the network.
Documention:
.helps in troubleshooting network problem
.includes a topology and a detailed listing of IP address
*Documention should always be updated.

Lesson 8

Internet Protocol Routing

Objectives
.Explain how a router determines the best path
.Configure static routes, floating static routes, and default routes
.Describe general characteristics of routing protocols
.List the common administrative distance
.Explain the methods of packet forwarding used in Cisco devices

Routing and Information Sources
Routing is forwarding a packet to another network or subnet. Routers select the best path to each destination network.
Routers add routes to their routing table from:
.connected routes,
.static routes, and
.routes learned by using dynamic routing protocols

Connect Networks
show ip route command

Next Hop
The next hop is the next router encountered when the packet leaves the egress interface.
. For Rtr3, the next hop out for the Fa0/0 interface was Rtr1.
. Rtr1 and Rtr2, must also have a route in its routing table to the destination, or the packet will be dropped
* all router between the source and the destination must have routes to the destination

Active Interfaces
A route will be in the routing table only if its interface is active.

Static Routes 
In configuration mode, enter ip route,then network and network mask. You have a choice of interface or next-hop-ip-address.Finally, administrative distance (AD) can be configured, although this is optional
.Rtr3(config)# ip route network mask [interface | next-hop-IP-address] {ad}
For serial point-to-point interfaces, use internet. for the ethernet interfaces, use next-hop-IP-address
.Rtr3(config)# ip route 10.1.12.0 255.255.255.0 f0/0
.Rtr3(config)# ip route 10.1.12.0 255.255.255.0 10.1.13.1

Floating Static Routes
Floating static routes provide a backup route in case the preferred route is no longer available
.For 10.1.0.0/16, a backup route can be configured as :
ip route 10.1.0.0 0.0.255.255 f1/0 220
*this route would not be used unless the preferred route is failed

Default Routes
A default route is the route taken if there is no more specific route for a destination in the routing table
.It can be a static route or it can be determined by dynamic routing protocols
.The routing table for Rtr3 in the topology after adding the staic routes is as follows:
Rtr3#show ip route

Gateway of last resort is not set
      25.0.0.0/30 is subnetted, 1 subnets
  C     25.25.25.0 is directly connected, Fast Ethernet1/0
      10.0.0.0/24 is subnetted, 3 subnets
  C   10.1.13.0 is directly connected, fastethernet0/0
  S   10.1.12.0 [1/0} via 10.1.13.1
  C   10.1.23.0 is directly connected=, fastethernet 0/1
  
Configiuring Default Routes
The static route Defined on Rtr3 is ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 FastEthernet1/0
Rtr3#show ip route

IP Default-Network Command

To configure a default route:
Rtr3(config)# ip default-network network-number

With the ip default-network command, each downstream router treats this router's route as a default for network-number
Rtr3(config)# ip default-network 25.0.0.0

Dynamic Routing
In dynamic routing, the routers communicate with each other using the same routing protocol.
. Dynamic routing protocols choose the best route based on a metric, if more than one possible route exists to reach one subnet.
. In dynamic routing, routes do not have to be manually configured.

Routing Protocols vs Routed Protocols
Routing protocols are used to implement dynamic routing.
Examples include:
. Routing Information Protocol (RIP)
. Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP)
. Open Shortest Path First (OSPF)
. Boarder Gateway Protocol (BGP)

Routed protocols or routable are Layer 3 protocols that transfer data from one host to another across a router.
i.e
. Internet Protocol Version 4 (IPv4)
. Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6)

Autonosmous Systems
An Autonomos System (AS) is a network under common administrative control.

                |------------Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) is used within an AS
Routing protocols
                |------------Exterior Gateway Protocol (EGP) routes between AS

Catergories of Routing protocols are as follows:
The categories of routing protocols are as follows:

Distance vector
.Uses the vector and the distance to a destination 
Enhanced distance vector
.Uses more thanvector and distance to create the routing table
Link-state
.Uses the shortest path first algorithm to create network topology


Metrics
Routing protocols use metrics to determine the best path. Metrics used by various routing protocols are as follows:
. RIP-Hop count
. EIGRP-A calculated value (bandwidth, delay etc.)
. OSPF-Cost(bandwidth of the link)


Administrative Distance
Each routing source is assigned a number from 0 to 255
. A value of 0 means trustworthy; 255 means the route will not be entered in the routing table.
. The route with the lowest administrative distance is preferred
. The destination networks must be identical for administrative distance (AD)to be taken into consideration

Table lists the administrative distance for routing protocols.

Route Source                  |  Default Ad
Connected interface              0  
Static route                     1
EIGRP summary route              5
External BGP                     20
Internal EIGRP                   90
OSPF                             110
RIPv1, RIPv2                     120
External EIGRP                   170
Internal BGP                     200
Unreachable-not put in           255

Forwarding Methods for Routers
The methods to forward packets by Cisco device are as follows:

Process switching
.CPU processes each packet separately
Fast switching
.Uses a cache to store the Layer 2 header and outgoing interface 
Cisco Express Forwarding (CEF)
.Default packet forwarding method used on the latest Cisco routers

Cisco Device Basics
A new switch can provide basic switching capabilities with no configuration.
.A router requires configuration
.A console connection is required to access a Cisco device until an IP address is configured.

Console Port
A Cisco console port requires a rollover cable with an RJ-45 connector.
.A rollover cable pinouts are 1 through 8 on one side, and 8 through 1 on the other.
.A serial Connection with a DB-9 connector is used while connecting to the console port from a PC
.A terminal application is used on the PC to access the serial port.

                  Serial Settings
Baud rate                | 9600
Data bits                | 8
