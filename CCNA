Network-

  .A network is collection of devices that are connected through media. The characteristics of a network are as follows:
    
    .Devices contain services and resources.
    .Network connects users to the available services.
    .Connecting devices allow users to share resources more efficiently.
    
Internetworking Models

  .With the inception of networks, hardware and software from different manufacturers could not interoperate. 
  To build hardware and software that can interoperate, a model with communication functions is required.
  
    .Importance of Internetworking Models
      .They encourage interoperability
      .Models provide a reference to describe the process of data communication
      .Models Facilitate modular engineering (high layer - low layer)
      
Types of Networking Models

  .Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) reference model
  .Transmission Control Protocol/ Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) model
  
OSI Reference Model was developed by the International Standards Organization (ISO). The 7 layers of (OSI) 
Reference Model are as follows:

  .User
    .Layer 7

Network Topology
  .Network topology deals with how devices are connected (search for a chart as refrence)
  .The different network topologies are as shown below.
    .Point-to-Point Topology
    .Bus Topology
    .Ring Topology
    .Star Topology
    .Full Mesh Topology
    .Partial Mesh Topology

Point-to-Point Topology
  .In a point-to-point topology, only 2 devices are connected to each other through the medium. This 
  is typical in Wide Area Network (WAN) connections.
  
          DEVICE A .---------------------------------. DEVICE B

Bus Topology
  In bus topology, all device are attached to a single cable. This was used for Token Ring networks.
  
  
  CABLE------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
              ^                             ^                                   ^
          Device A                      Device B                            Device C

Ring Topology
  .In a ring toplogy, each device is attached to only one other device either side. This is often used
  with severs.
  
                        Device A                      Device D
                                        O
                        Device B                      Device C

Star Topology
  .In a star topology, multiple devices are connected to a central device. This is the most widespread topology
  in networks today.
  
  PC-A---------------------------|                      |----------------------------PC-B

  PC-C---------------------------|                      |----------------------------PC-D
  
  Full Mesh Topology
    .In full mesh toplogy, all the device are interconnected. There are many backup paths from one
    device to another.
    
    Device A -                                                  - Device D
    
                                  X
    
    Device B -                                                  - Device C
  
Partial Mesh
  .In a partial mesh topology, some of the full mesh connections are dropped. This makes is less
  expensive and easier to implement.

  Core                                        .It has high bandwidth links.
                                              .It connects the distribution layer device to each other and 
                                              the centralized resource.
                                              .It consists of high-end switches
  
  Distribution                                .It provides routing, packet filtering using Access Control List
                                              (ACL's), and Quality of Service (QoS).
                                              .WAN access also occurs at this layer.
                                              .Routers and Layer 3 switches are used here.
                                              
  Access                                      .End devices connect to the network, usually with a switch.
  
  Layer 1 and 2 ethernet
    .Ethernet is the most widely used technology for Local Area Networks (LANs) today.
    It is a FAMILY of standards maintained by the Institute of Electrical Engineers (IEEE) defined into
    two OSI model layers:
                                    Layer 1 (physical)
    OSI Model Layers-----------------|
                                    Layer 2 (data Link)
                                    
  IEEE Ethernet standards are given below:
  
                                                                 IEEE Ethernet Standards

Ethernet at the Physical Layer
  .There are many physical layers in the Ethernet standards. However, they use the same data link layer standards.
    .The maximum length of a copper cable is 100 meters (about 328 feet) for most standards.
    .The standards listed for copper use Unshielded Twisted Pair (UTP) copper cable, expect Thicknet.
      !!!! Characteristics of Ethernet !!!!
        .The UTP cable used contains 4 pairs of wires
        .Only 2 of the pairs are used for Ethernet and FastEthernet
        .All 4 pairs are used for GigabitEthernet

Ethernet Data Link Layer
  !!!! The IEEE splits the Ethernet data link layer into two sublayers !!!!

                                    Sublayers
                            |                           |
            802.3 Media Access Control (MAC)      802.2 Logical Link Control (LLC)
                            |                           |
    Responsible for data encapsulation and          Handles communication within Layers 1 and 3
    addressing.
    
Media Access Control Address
  .The Media Access Control (MAC) address is the physical address of the Network INterface Card (NIC).
  it consists of 48 bits (6 bytes) respresented in hexadecimal digits.
    .The first 3 bytes are the Organizantionally Unique Identifier (OUI) that indicates the vendor.
    .The last 3 bytes are assigned by the vendor.
  !!!! this address can be assigned or it can be a Burned-In-Address (BIA) !!!!
  
Ethernet Frame
  .The fields and functions of Ethernet Frame are shown below.
  
  Fields                                            Functions
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Preamble                                          Provides sychronization.
  Start Frame Delimiter                             Signals the beginning of address
  MAC Destination Address                           This is the destination of the frame
  MAC Source Address                                This is the source of the frame
  Protocol Type                                     This usually the code for IPv4 (0x0800) or IPv6 (0x86DD).
  Data                                              It contains Layer 1 bytes. Padding is added to meet the minimum 46-byte
                                                    requirement, if necessary.
  Frame Check Sequence (FCS)                        This is used to check for transmission errors.
  
Duplex
  .Devices communicate with each other using full or half duplex.
  
  ! Half duplex !
    .Only one device can transmit over the medium at a time.
    .Data collisions are possible with half duplex.
    
  ! Full duplex !
    .Both devices can trasmit and recieve at the same time.
    .Switches and router can use full duplex.

Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection
  .To detect collisions in half duplex communication, Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision
  Detection (CSMA/CD) is used. This is a contention method.
    .When a device has a frame to transmit, it monitors until there is no activity on the medium.
    .It sends the frame, but also listens at the same time.
    .If the devcie detects other signals on the medium, there is a collision.
    .In case of a collision, all devices transmitting at that time send a jamming signal. Each then
    chooses a random amount of time before retransmitting. This called the backoff time.
    
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  .A TCP header contains the following fields, among others:
    .Source and destination port numbers,
    .Sequence number,
    .Acknowledgement number,
    .Window size, and
    .Checksum.
  
  Each segment is assigned a sequence number. The sequence numbers are used:
    .To determine any segment that require retransmission.
    .To reassemble the segment in order, at the destination.

  .Is a 3-way "handshake" which is the beginning of a TCP connection.
    1. SYN - the source sends the sequence number
    2. SYN/ACK - acknowledeges the number andis ready for another one
    3. ACK - the source tells the destination to keep transmitting.
    
Windowing
  .Is a process used by TCP to contrl how much data is sent at once.
    !!!! If there is large amounts of traffic the window is made smaller !!!!
    !!!! If the bandwidth is available the window is increased !!!!

User Datagram Protocol

                                                        UDP Header Fields
                                    Source Port (16 bits)           |           Destination Ports (16 bits)
                                    Length (16 bits)                |           Checksum (16 bits)
                                                                   DATA

  UDP is used when:
    .reliable transport is not necessary, for example, when looking up a DNS name.
    .the delay introduced by TCP is unacceptable, for example, in Voice over IP (VoIP).
  
Port Numbers
  .Assigning of port numbers are as followed
    0 - 1023          | Well-known ports
    1024 - 49151      | Registered ports
    49152 - 65535     | Private or dynamic ports
      
      !!!! TCP and UDP both use port numbers as address !!!!
      !!!! Dynamic ports are used to allocate ephemeral ports !!!!
      !!!! Well-Known or registered ports are used for destination ports !!!!
      
Layers 3 Protocols
  .Layer 3 adds an Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) or Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) source
  and destination address to the segement recieved from Layer 4.
    . IP source and Destination address are the logical address for a device or router interface.
    . This compares to the physical addresses that are used at Layer 2.
    
  Other important protocols at Layer 3 for IPv4 are:
    .Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)
    .Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)
    
Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)

      !!!! ARP request message sent out !!!!
      .Looking for the physical (MAC) address of anode with IP address is:
      192.168.1.120
      
Router/Host (ARP request)
  IP: 192.168.1.110
  IP: 192.168.1.120
  IP: 192.168.1.130
  
                                                IP: 192.168.1.110
  Router/Host        (ARP reply) -----------    IP: 192.168.1.120
                      Physical Address is       IP: 192.168.1.130
                      02-FE-05-A7-00-01

Internet Protocol Version 4 Header
  !!!! different headers of Internet Protocol Version 4 (IPv4) !!!!
  
  | IP Version No. 4 | IHL (4 bits) | Type of Service (8 bits)  | Total Length (16 bits)|
  | Identification (16 bits) |          Flags (4 bits)    |    Fragment offset (12 bits)|
  | Time to Live (8 bits)    |      Protocol (8 bits)     |    Header Checksum (16 bits)|
  |                               Source Address (32 bits)                              |

  | Options (variable)                        |               Padding (variable)        |
  
  !!!! (IPv4) TTL and bits concerning fragmentation feild and function of IPv4 !!!!
    .If the number of bytes in the data, causes the packet to be too big to send to the network, it is fragmented. 
    (meaning it is sent in more than one IP packet)
    .When a packet arrives at a router, the router decriments the TTL field by 1, When the TTL feild is 0 the router discards the packet
    .TTL prevents the packets from looking for a none exsisting address indefinitly.
    .Without TTL there would be many packets taken up bandwidth.
    
Layer 2 Protocol
  .Addressing used at layer 2 is flat.
  .There is no hierarchy involved.
  
                                            Layer 2 Protocols

IPv4 Addressing and Subnetting
  Objectives !
    .Discuss IP address
    .Convert binary numbers to decimals
    .Discuss classes
    .Create subnets
-------------------------------------
IPv4 Address
  .An IPv4 address is a 32-bit numeric identifier assigned to each device on an IP network.
    > Unicast- The packet is sent to only one device.
    > Multicast- The packet to many devices 
    > Broadcast- The packet is sent to all devices in a network or subnet.
    > Public- These addresses can be used over the internet.
    > Private- These addresses are used only within a LAN.

Private Addresses
  . Are also called Request for Comments (RFCs) 1918 addresses.
  . Can only be used within a private network.
  . Cannot be routed through the internet.
  . Enable organizations to work with fewer routable address.
  
Binary Numbering 
  .Counting in binary system is similar to counting in any other number system.
    >Binary system
      .sends signals that are interpreted as either 0 (zero) or 1 (one)
      .Works in the same way as the decimal system except that it uses only 0 and 1
    
    >Decimal system
      .Uses 10 symbols
      .Signifies a power of 10 when each digit is added to a decimal number
  
Bits and Bytes
  !!! terms are related to digital information in computing !!!
    .A bit is one digit, either a 1 or a 0
    .A byte is 8 bits.
    .An octet is a byte used in the IPv4 address dotted decimal format.
Bits and Bytes (contd.)

  |     Binary Number                 |       Power of 2      |   Decimal Equivalent      | 
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  |       00000001                    |       -               |         1                 |
  |       00000010                    |     2^1               |         2                 |
  |       00000100                    |     2^2               |         4                 |
  |       00001000                    |     2^3               |         8                 |
  |       00010000                    |     2^4               |         16                |
  |       00100000                    |     2^5               |         32                |
  |       01000000                    |     2^6               |         64                |

  Binary to Dotted Decimal
  A dotted decimal address in binary is 4 bytes seperated by periods. 
    !!!! Example !!!!
      11000000.00010000.00001101.00000001 = the decimal equivalent is: 192.16.13.1

Converting Binary To Decimal
  .To convert 10110001 to a decimal number, find the place values of 1 bit in the binary number:
    .There is a 1 in the 2^7 place = 128.
    .There is a 1 in the 2^5 place. the decimal equation becomes 128 + 32 = 160
    .There is a 1 in the 2^4 place. The decimal equation becomes 160 + 16 = 176
    .Finally, there is a 1 in the ones column
    .Add 1 to 176
    .Result is 177. the decimal equivalent of the binary number 101110001 is 177
    
Special Addresses
  !!! Three types of special address are as follow !!!
    >Host 
      .Refers to an address that can be assigned to a network device
    > Network 
      .Refers to an address that represents an entire network.
    > Broadcast
      .Refers to the last address belonging to the network

Valid Host Addresses
  .Valid host address are address between the network and the broadcast address. The number of valid host address is 2^n-2, (n)
  is the number of host bits borrowed for the subnet.
    Class A network - The valid host addresses are 10.0.0.1 through 10.255.255.254
    Class B network - The valid addresses are 172.16.0.1 through 172.16.255.254
    Class C network - The valid host address 192.168.100.1 through 192.168.100.254

Subnet Masks 
  .A subnet mask
    .defines the number of bits that represent the network and subnet part of the address.
    .identifies the destination IP address and determines network path Layer 3 devices

Subnets 
  Class A, B, or C networks can be subdivided into smaller networks called subnets.
  The advantage of subnetting are as follows:
    .Smaller networks are easier to manage
    .Overall traffic is reduced
    .Network security policies are more easily applied

Creating Subnets
  .Subnets can be created by borrwoing bits from the bits to creat a subnet field.
    !!! Using 1-bit for the subnet field 2^1 or 2 possible subnets !!! refer to bits and bytes for further break down
  ** With 6-bits for the subnet field only two bits are left for the host, that yeilds 2^2 or 4 host.
  ** Two address are set aside for network and broadcast address. At this point, no subnetting is possible. 
  .A Variable Length Subnet Mask (VLSM) address uses such subnets.
  .the IP SUBNET-ZERO command needs to be considered when counting the number of subnets.

VLSM Summarization and Troubleshooting TCP IP

Objectives!

  . Describe the benefits of VLSM's
  . Calculate VLSM IP addressing design to a network
  . Describe subnetting a network
  . Define summarization and switching
  . Describe the switching process and routing
  . Explain troubleshooting steps for TCP/IP
-----------------------------------------------------
Variable Length Subnet Masks (VLSMs)

VLSMs allow a network administrator to create many networks from a large single network using subnets masks of different lengths.
  . The Subnet address is created by taking address bits from the host portion of Class A, Class B, and Class C addresses.
  . When taking (borrowing) a bit from the host feild the number of additional subnets created double each time.
---------------------------------------------------------  
Advantage of VLSMs Addressing Design

VLSMs provide two major advantages:
  . More effecient use of addressing
  . Ability to perform route summarization
  
When borrowing a bit from the host field, the number of additional subnets created is doubled each time.

For example:
. Borrowing 1 bit creates two possible subnets (2^1=2).
. Borrowing 2 bits creates four possible subnets (2^2=4).
** the number of bits borrowed determines the block size.

Block Size

Block size is the number of address in the subnet.

. A block size must be a power of 2 and large enough to accommodate 2 address that must be reserved- the network and the broadcast addresses.
. Therefore the usable portion of the block size is a power of 2 minus 2.

For example:
  . If you need 27 hosts, a block size of 32 is required. 2^5-2=30 hosts are available.
  . If you need 13 hosts, a block size of 16 is required. 2^4-2=14 hosts are available.
  . If you need 62 hosts, a block size of 32 is required. 2^8-2=126 hosts are available.

. A point to point serial link to another router needs only 2 hosts and a block size of 4.

Subnetting

Subnetting is done by borrowing host bits and using them as network bits.

Subnetting is useful to:
  . simplify network administration.
  . enable different uses of physical media subnet as Ethernet and FDDI.
  . add layers of security to network.
  
  Example of Subnetting
  
  . (A) network uses Class (B) network address where 16 bits are used for the network and 16 bits for the hosts.
  . the network administator has to create 4 subnets
  . there are 65,536 (2^16) possible addresses, of these, 65,534 are usable addresses.
  . If two bits are borrowed, 14 host bits are left.
  . Possible combinations of 0s and 1s occur in the remaining 14 bits.
  . this gives 16,384 possible hosts for each subnet.
