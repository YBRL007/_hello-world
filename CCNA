Network-

  .A network is collection of devices that are connected through media. The characteristics of a network are as follows:
    
    .Devices contain services and resources.
    .Network connects users to the available services.
    .Connecting devices allow users to share resources more efficiently.
    
Internetworking Models

  .With the inception of networks, hardware and software from different manufacturers could not interoperate. 
  To build hardware and software that can interoperate, a model with communication functions is required.
  
    .Importance of Internetworking Models
      .They encourage interoperability
      .Models provide a reference to describe the process of data communication
      .Models Facilitate modular engineering (high layer - low layer)
      
Types of Networking Models

  .Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) reference model
  .Transmission Control Protocol/ Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) model
  
OSI Reference Model was developed by the International Standards Organization (ISO). The 7 layers of (OSI) 
Reference Model are as follows:

Network Topology
  .Network topology deals with how devices are connected (search for a chart as refrence)
  .The different network topologies are as shown below.
    .Point-to-Point Topology
    .Bus Topology
    .Ring Topology
    .Star Topology
    .Full Mesh Topology
    .Partial Mesh Topology

Point-to-Point Topology
  .In a point-to-point topology, only 2 devices are connected to each other through the medium. This 
  is typical in Wide Area Network (WAN) connections.
  
          DEVICE A .---------------------------------. DEVICE B

Bus Topology
  In bus topology, all device are attached to a single cable. This was used for Token Ring networks.
  
  
  CABLE------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
              ^                             ^                                   ^
          Device A                      Device B                            Device C

Ring Topology
  .In a ring toplogy, each device is attached to only one other device either side. This is often used
  with severs.
  
                        Device A                      Device D
                                        O
                        Device B                      Device C

Star Topology
  .In a star topology, multiple devices are connected to a central device. This is the most widespread topology
  in networks today.
  
  PC-A---------------------------|                      |----------------------------PC-B

  PC-C---------------------------|                      |----------------------------PC-D
  
  Full Mesh Topology
    .In full mesh toplogy, all the device are interconnected. There are many backup paths from one
    device to another.
    
    Device A -                                                  - Device D
    
                                  X
    
    Device B -                                                  - Device C
  
Partial Mesh
  .In a partial mesh topology, some of the full mesh connections are dropped. This makes is less
  expensive and easier to implement.

  Core                                        .It has high bandwidth links.
                                              .It connects the distribution layer device to each other and 
                                              the centralized resource.
                                              .It consists of high-end switches
  
  Distribution                                .It provides routing, packet filtering using Access Control List
                                              (ACL's), and Quality of Service (QoS).
                                              .WAN access also occurs at this layer.
                                              .Routers and Layer 3 switches are used here.
                                              
  Access                                      .End devices connect to the network, usually with a switch.
  
  Layer 1 and 2 ethernet
    .Ethernet is the most widely used technology for Local Area Networks (LANs) today.
    It is a FAMILY of standards maintained by the Institute of Electrical Engineers (IEEE) defined into
    two OSI model layers:
                                    Layer 1 (physical)
    OSI Model Layers-----------------|
                                    Layer 2 (data Link)
                                    
  IEEE Ethernet standards are given below:
  
                                                                 IEEE Ethernet Standards

Ethernet at the Physical Layer
  .There are many physical layers in the Ethernet standards. However, they use the same data link layer standards.
    .The maximum length of a copper cable is 100 meters (about 328 feet) for most standards.
    .The standards listed for copper use Unshielded Twisted Pair (UTP) copper cable, expect Thicknet.
      !!!! Characteristics of Ethernet !!!!
        .The UTP cable used contains 4 pairs of wires
        .Only 2 of the pairs are used for Ethernet and FastEthernet
        .All 4 pairs are used for GigabitEthernet

Ethernet Data Link Layer
  !!!! The IEEE splits the Ethernet data link layer into two sublayers !!!!

                                    Sublayers
                            |                           |
            802.3 Media Access Control (MAC)      802.2 Logical Link Control (LLC)
                            |                           |
    Responsible for data encapsulation and          Handles communication within Layers 1 and 3
    addressing.
    
Media Access Control Address
  .The Media Access Control (MAC) address is the physical address of the Network INterface Card (NIC).
  it consists of 48 bits (6 bytes) respresented in hexadecimal digits.
    .The first 3 bytes are the Organizantionally Unique Identifier (OUI) that indicates the vendor.
    .The last 3 bytes are assigned by the vendor.
  !!!! this address can be assigned or it can be a Burned-In-Address (BIA) !!!!
  
Ethernet Frame
  .The fields and functions of Ethernet Frame are shown below.
  
  Fields                                            Functions
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Preamble                                          Provides sychronization.
  Start Frame Delimiter                             Signals the beginning of address
  MAC Destination Address                           This is the destination of the frame
  MAC Source Address                                This is the source of the frame
  Protocol Type                                     This usually the code for IPv4 (0x0800) or IPv6 (0x86DD).
  Data                                              It contains Layer 1 bytes. Padding is added to meet the minimum 46-byte
                                                    requirement, if necessary.
  Frame Check Sequence (FCS)                        This is used to check for transmission errors.
  
Duplex
  .Devices communicate with each other using full or half duplex.
  
  ! Half duplex !
    .Only one device can transmit over the medium at a time.
    .Data collisions are possible with half duplex.
    
  ! Full duplex !
    .Both devices can trasmit and recieve at the same time.
    .Switches and router can use full duplex.

Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection
  .To detect collisions in half duplex communication, Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision
  Detection (CSMA/CD) is used. This is a contention method.
    .When a device has a frame to transmit, it monitors until there is no activity on the medium.
    .It sends the frame, but also listens at the same time.
    .If the devcie detects other signals on the medium, there is a collision.
    .In case of a collision, all devices transmitting at that time send a jamming signal. Each then
    chooses a random amount of time before retransmitting. This called the backoff time.
    
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
