Internetworking-

Objectives !

  .Explain internetworking models
  .List the types of internetworking models
  .Discuss the OSI Reference Model and its layer
  .Describe the role of different devices that comprise a network
  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Network-

  .A network is collection of devices that are connected through media. The characteristics of a network are as follows:
    
    .Devices contain services and resources.
    .Network connects users to the available services.
    .Connecting devices allow users to share resources more efficiently.
    
Internetworking Models

  .With the inception of networks, hardware and software from different manufacturers could not interoperate. To build hardware and software that can interoperate, a model with communication functions is required.
  
    .Importance of Internetworking Models
      .They encourage interoperability
      .Models provide a reference to describe the process of data communication
      .Models Facilitate modular engineering (high layer - low layer)
      
Types of Networking Models

  .Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) reference model
  .Transmission Control Protocol/ Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) model
  
OSI Reference Model was developed by the International Standards Organization (ISO). The 7 layers of (OSI) Reference Model are as follows:

  .User
    .Layer 7
      Application
    .Layer 6
      Presentation
    .Layer 5
      Session
    .Layer 4
      Transport
    .Layer 3
      Network
    .Layer 2
      Data Link
    .Layer 1
      Physical (copper cable)

!!!! Layers represent processing that must be communicated through the data !!!!

Network Topology
  .Network topology deals with how devices are connected (search for a chart as refrence)
  .The different network topologies are as shown below.
    .Point-to-Point Topology
    .Bus Topology
    .Ring Topology
    .Star Topology
    .Full Mesh Topology
    .Partial Mesh Topology

Point-to-Point Topology
  .In a point-to-point topology, only 2 devices are connected to each other through the medium. This 
  is typical in Wide Area Network (WAN) connections.
  
          DEVICE A .---------------------------------. DEVICE B

Bus Topology
  In bus topology, all device are attached to a single cable. This was used for Token Ring networks.
  
  
  CABLE------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
              ^                             ^                                   ^
          Device A                      Device B                            Device C

Ring Topology
  .In a ring toplogy, each device is attached to only one other device either side. This is often used
  with severs.
  
                        Device A                      Device D
                                        O
                        Device B                      Device C

Star Topology
  .In a star topology, multiple devices are connected to a central device. This is the most widespread topology
  in networks today.
  
  PC-A---------------------------|                      |----------------------------PC-B
                                        
                                        Switch
  
  PC-C---------------------------|                      |----------------------------PC-D
  
  Full Mesh Topology
    .In full mesh toplogy, all the device are interconnected. There are many backup paths from one
    device to another.
    
    Device A -                                                  - Device D
    
                                  X
    
    Device B -                                                  - Device C
  
Partial Mesh
  .In a partial mesh topology, some of the full mesh connections are dropped. This makes is less
  expensive and easier to implement.

Hierarchical Network Model
  .the hierarchical network model can help accomplish the goals of anetwork. Networks should have the following qualities:
    .Modular
      adding to the network does not require redesigning
    .Resilient
      The network can recover quickly from a node failure
    .Flexiable
      Modifying the network is faster and easier

Layer Requirements 
  .The different layers and their requirements are given below:
  
  Layers                                      Requirements
  
  Core                                        .It has high bandwidth links.
                                              .It connects the distribution layer device to each other and 
                                              the centralized resource.
                                              .It consists of high-end switches
  
  Distribution                                .It provides routing, packet filtering using Access Control List
                                              (ACL's), and Quality of Service (QoS).
                                              .WAN access also occurs at this layer.
                                              .Routers and Layer 3 switches are used here.
                                              
  Access                                      .End devices connect to the network, usually with a switch.
  
  Layer 1 and 2 ethernet
    .Ethernet is the most widely used technology for Local Area Networks (LANs) today.
    It is a FAMILY of standards maintained by the Institute of Electrical Engineers (IEEE) defined into
    two OSI model layers:
                                    Layer 1 (physical)
